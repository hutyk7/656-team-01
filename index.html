                <p>ZEN Cottages were founded by architect Andrew Shimmer and his wife Carol. They wanted to create
                    classically-designed, efficient, and prefabricated structures that could be easily moved,
                    contracted,
                    expanded, and sold while maintaining both integrity and aesthetics.</p>
                <p>The company respects the natural environment and deeply cares about it. Therefore, we do our best to
                    use
                    building constructions and delivery systems that are flexible and have minimal impact on the land
                    they occupy.
