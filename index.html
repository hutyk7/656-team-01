          ZEN Cottages were founded by architect Andrew Shimmer and his wife
          Carol. They wanted to create classically-designed, efficient, and
          prefabricated structures that could be easily moved, contracted,
          expanded, and sold while maintaining both integrity and aesthetics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company respects the natural environment and deeply cares about
          it. Therefore, we do our best to use building constructions and
          delivery systems that are flexible and have minimal impact on the
          land they occupy.
